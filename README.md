Shrinking URLs รก la skill share. 

This README file contains 3 main sections: 

1. Intro to Shrink 
2. Configuration
3. Using the CLI 

## Introduction to Shrink

Shrink is a ver basic tool that, essentially, shrinks URLs via CLI using a REST API and MongoDB. It has two main components:

- The API: This enables all services to shrink and redirect to source URLs.
- The CLI: This is the official interface to access all Shrink functionality.

### Available Operations

Shrink allows you to:

- Shrink any URL: You can use the CLI with the `this:` command to obtain the shrunk URL. See more details in the "Using the CLI" section below.
- Get stats from any shrunk URL (or the 'original' URL, works both ways): You can use the CLI with the `stats:` command.
- Toggle on/off any shrunk URL (or the 'original' URL): You can use the CLI with the `toggle:` command.

## Configuration

### Required Configuration

First, you want to add a `.env` file with the following entries:

```SHRINK_DOMAIN=sho.rt # value set to anything you want to use (our choice is `shri.nk`)
   PORT=80              # (check you have permissions to open that port on your host)
   DB_HOST=localhost```

### Optional Configuration

You may want to add a line to your `/etc/hosts` file to have nice routing to your defined domain (see above).

#### CLI Configuration

Our CLI works as a node command that is executed by npm. In turn, we advise you create an alias so that it can be used with ease:

`alias shrink='npm run cli'`

#### Docker Mongo Instance

Run a local image of MongoDB to avoid installing anything:

`docker pull mongo:3-xenial && docker run -d --name mongo-container -p 27017:27017 mongo:3-xenial`

## Using Shrink CLI

You can shrink an url by passing the command `this:`. NOTE: This call is idempotent, meaning that it will return on every equal request the same shrunk URL after it has been shrunk the first time.

You can also retrieve stats of the times this shrunk URL has been used by passing the `stats:` command.

`shrink stats: http://shri.nk/emI05`

Finally, your shrunk URL can be disabled temporarily, by passing the `toggle:` command. It will return 409 if the URL is used while disabled. This call is a switch to alternate between 'enabled' and 'disabled' status.
